# Apple Stock Predictor

ðŸ“ˆ **Interactive Apple Stock Predictor** â€” Predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock closing prices using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models based on historical data.

---

## Project Overview

This project forecasts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock closing prices using historical stock data from 2020 to 2024. It implements multiple models including:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural network)  
- Ensemble model combining Linear Regression and LSTM  

The goal is to compare the effectiveness of classical machine learning methods and deep learning approaches for time series stock price prediction.

## Features

- Download historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)  
- Feature engineering with lagged closing prices and moving averages  
- Train/test split preserving time series order  
- Models implemented:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - LSTM with PyTorch  
  - Ensemble of Linear Regression and LSTM  
- Performance evaluation with RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics  
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices  
- Interactive web app built with Streamlit  
- PDF report generation with prediction summary and stock trend plots

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Poorna-Kaushalya/Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Time-Series-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Train the Models

Run the training script to download data, train models, evaluate, and save the Linear Regression model:

```bash
python daily_update.py
```

### Run the Streamlit App

Launch the interactive web app for prediction and PDF report generation:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Details

### Linear Regression

* Uses lagged opening price, lagged closing price, 7-day and 14-day moving averages as features
* Fast, interpretable, and best performance among tested models on this dataset

### Random Forest Regressor

* Ensemble tree-based model
* Did not perform well on this time series dataset likely due to temporal dependencies

### LSTM Neural Network

* Deep learning model for sequential data
* Uses scaled closing prices and sequences of 60 days for training

### Ensemble Model

* Averages predictions from Linear Regression and LSTM models
* Improves accuracy by combining strengths of both
